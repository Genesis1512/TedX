           TEDx, an independently organized program licensed by TED, is an emblematic platform for fostering the dissemination of "Ideas Worth Spreading." The acronym TED originally stood for Technology, Entertainment, and Design, and TEDx has extended this legacy, incorporating various disciplines and subjects. These localized events gather thought leaders, visionaries, artists, and innovators to share their insights and experiences in the signature TED talk formatâ€”a compelling presentation of 18 minutes or less.

           TEDx events are organized by a team of volunteers who work together to bring the event to life. The team usually includes a lead organizer, who is responsible for overseeing the event and managing the team, a speaker curator, who selects and coaches the speakers, a marketing and communications coordinator, who promotes the event and manages social media, a sponsor coordinator, who secures funding and partnerships, and a logistics coordinator, who handles the event's technical and operational needs. Other roles may include volunteer coordinators, graphic designers, and stage managers.            </div>
